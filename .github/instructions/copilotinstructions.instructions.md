Always use SOLID principles, design patterns, and best practices in your code.
Use meaningful variable and function names, and write clear, concise comments.
Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles, writing tests before implementing features.
Once a test is passed, don't change it unless necessary. First check if the test is still valid, then refactor the code if needed.
If there are conflicting tests, fix the requirements first, then the tests.
Always use a text file to keep track of the tasks and issues, and update it (like in progress, done, etc.). 
Link the related test file for each task/feature.
Your python environement is `conda activate ibkr-tax`. 
After every change, run all tests to ensure everything is working correctly.
