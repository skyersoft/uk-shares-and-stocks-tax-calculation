# Risk Management Fundamentals: How to Protect Your Capital and Stay in the Game

In the world of trading, there's a saying: "Amateurs think about how much money they can make. Professionals think about how much money they can lose."

This single sentence captures the essence of what separates successful traders from the 90% who fail. It’s not about finding a "holy grail" indicator or a perfect entry signal. It’s about **risk management**.

Risk management is the practice of protecting your trading capital. It is your defense, your insurance policy, and the foundation upon which a profitable trading career is built. Without it, even the most brilliant trading strategy will eventually lead to a blown account. This guide breaks down the essential, non-negotiable fundamentals of risk management.

## The Golden Rule: The 1% Rule
If you only take one thing away from this article, let it be this: **Never risk more than 1-2% of your trading account on a single trade.**

This is the golden rule of trading. It ensures that you can withstand a string of losses without significantly damaging your account. A losing streak is a statistical certainty, no matter how good your strategy is. The 1% rule guarantees your survival.

Let's see it in action:
*   **Account Size:** £10,000
*   **Risk per Trade:** 1% (£100)

If you have a string of 10 consecutive losses (a rare but possible event), your account will be down £1,000, or 10%. You still have £9,000 and are very much in the game.

Now, let's see what happens if you risk 10% per trade:
*   **Account Size:** £10,000
*   **Risk per Trade:** 10% (£1,000)

After just three consecutive losses, your account is down to £7,000. After five losses, you're at £5,000—a 50% drawdown. To get back to break-even, you now need to make a 100% return, a monumental task. The 1% rule prevents this catastrophic scenario.

## Position Sizing: Your Most Powerful Tool
The 1% rule is not about the amount of money you invest; it's about the amount you stand to *lose*. This is controlled through **position sizing**.

Position sizing is the process of calculating how many shares, lots, or contracts to buy or sell to ensure your potential loss does not exceed your pre-defined risk limit (e.g., 1% of your account).

To calculate your position size, you need three pieces of information:
1.  **Account Size:** The total value of your trading account.
2.  **Risk Percentage:** The percentage of your account you're willing to risk (e.g., 1%).
3.  **Stop-Loss Distance:** The distance in price from your entry point to your stop-loss order.

### The Position Size Formula:

**Position Size = (Account Size * Risk Percentage) / (Stop-Loss Distance)**

**Example:**
*   **Account Size:** £10,000
*   **Risk Percentage:** 1% (so, £100 risk)
*   **Stock:** You want to buy ABC plc at £10.
*   **Stop-Loss:** You place your stop-loss at £9.50.
*   **Stop-Loss Distance:** £10 - £9.50 = £0.50 per share.

**Calculation:**
Position Size = £100 / £0.50 = **200 shares**

By buying 200 shares, if the trade hits your stop-loss, you will lose exactly £100 (200 shares * £0.50 loss per share), which is 1% of your account. You have successfully controlled your risk.

## The Stop-Loss: Your Non-Negotiable Exit
A stop-loss order is a pre-set order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price. It is your automated defense mechanism that takes emotion out of the equation.

**Never, ever, enter a trade without a stop-loss.**

### Where to Place Your Stop-Loss
A stop-loss should not be placed at an arbitrary level (e.g., "I'll just risk 20 pips"). It must be placed at a logical level that **invalidates your original trade idea**.

*   **Technical Structure:** Place your stop-loss on the other side of a significant technical level. For a long trade, this could be below a recent swing low, a key support level, or a major moving average.
*   **Volatility:** Use indicators like Average True Range (ATR) to set a stop-loss based on the stock's recent volatility. For example, a common technique is to place the stop 2x ATR away from the entry price.

**Crucially, once a stop-loss is set, do not widen it.** Moving your stop-loss further away to "give the trade more room to breathe" is breaking your trading plan and turning a disciplined risk into a hopeful gamble.

## Risk/Reward Ratio: Stacking the Odds in Your Favour
The risk/reward ratio (R/R) compares the potential profit of a trade to its potential loss.

A positive R/R means your potential profit is greater than your potential loss. For a strategy to be profitable long-term, you need one of two things:
1.  A high win rate.
2.  A high risk/reward ratio.

Most professional traders aim for a minimum R/R of **1:2**, meaning they are risking £1 to make a potential £2. This gives you a significant edge.

**Example:**
*   **Win Rate:** 50% (you are right half the time)
*   **R/R:** 1:2

Over 10 trades, risking £100 per trade:
*   5 wins * £200 profit = +£1,000
*   5 losses * £100 loss = -£500
*   **Net Profit:** +£500

Even with a win rate below 50%, you can still be profitable.
*   **Win Rate:** 40%
*   **R/R:** 1:2

Over 10 trades:
*   4 wins * £200 profit = +£800
*   6 losses * £100 loss = -£600
*   **Net Profit:** +£200

By only taking trades where the potential reward is significantly greater than the risk, you don't have to be right all the time to make money.

## Conclusion: Risk Management is Your Career
Trading is a marathon, not a sprint. The market will always be there tomorrow, but only if you protect your capital today.

Mastering these fundamentals—the 1% rule, correct position sizing, disciplined use of stop-losses, and favourable risk/reward ratios—is the only way to ensure your longevity and eventual success as a trader. It’s not the most exciting part of trading, but it is, without question, the most important.
