# Understanding UK Capital Gains Tax on Stocks and Shares

Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is one of the most important taxes for UK investors to understand. Whether you're a seasoned trader or just starting your investment journey, understanding how CGT works can save you thousands of pounds and help you make more informed investment decisions.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about CGT on stocks and shares, including current rates, allowances, calculation methods, and practical strategies to minimize your tax liability.

## What is Capital Gains Tax?

**Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit (or 'gain') you make when you sell an asset for more than you paid for it.** For stocks and shares investors, this means any profit from selling shares, funds, investment trusts, or other securities is potentially subject to CGT.

### Key Principles:
- **Tax on profit only**: You only pay CGT on gains, not losses
- **Disposal trigger**: Tax is due when you sell, gift, or transfer assets
- **Annual allowance**: Everyone gets a tax-free allowance each year
- **Different rates**: Tax rates depend on your total income and type of asset

**Important**: CGT is separate from Income Tax on dividends - you may pay both taxes on the same investment.

## Current CGT Rates and Allowances (2024-25)

### Annual CGT Allowance
- **Individual allowance**: £3,000 per person per tax year
- **Married couples**: Each spouse gets their own £3,000 allowance
- **Use it or lose it**: Unused allowance cannot be carried forward

**Historical context**: The CGT allowance has been significantly reduced from £12,300 in 2022-23 to £3,000 in 2024-25, making tax planning more crucial than ever.

### CGT Tax Rates (2024-25)

**For most assets (including stocks and shares):**
- **Basic rate taxpayers**: 10%
- **Higher/additional rate taxpayers**: 20%

**For residential property (not covered in this guide):**
- **Basic rate taxpayers**: 18%
- **Higher/additional rate taxpayers**: 28%

### Determining Your Tax Rate

Your CGT rate depends on your total taxable income:

**Basic Rate Threshold Calculation:**
1. Add your total income (salary, dividends, interest, etc.)
2. Add your capital gains for the year
3. If the total exceeds £50,270 (2024-25), higher rate CGT applies

## Detailed CGT Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Rate Taxpayer

**Mark's Scenario:**
- Annual salary: £35,000
- Sold shares: £15,000 gain
- Total income + gains: £50,000

**CGT Calculation:**
- Gains: £15,000
- Less CGT allowance: £3,000
- Taxable gains: £12,000
- CGT rate: 10% (still basic rate taxpayer)
- **CGT due: £12,000 × 10% = £1,200**

### Example 2: Higher Rate Taxpayer

**Sarah's Scenario:**
- Annual salary: £80,000
- Sold shares: £10,000 gain
- Total income + gains: £90,000

**CGT Calculation:**
- Gains: £10,000
- Less CGT allowance: £3,000
- Taxable gains: £7,000
- CGT rate: 20% (higher rate taxpayer)
- **CGT due: £7,000 × 20% = £1,400**

### Example 3: Crossing Tax Bands

**James's Complex Scenario:**
- Annual salary: £45,000
- Capital gains: £20,000
- Total: £65,000 (crosses into higher rate)

**Detailed CGT Calculation:**
- Total gains: £20,000
- Less CGT allowance: £3,000
- Taxable gains: £17,000

**Split calculation:**
- Basic rate threshold: £50,270
- Available basic rate band: £50,270 - £45,000 = £5,270
- Gains taxed at 10%: £5,270 × 10% = £527
- Gains taxed at 20%: (£17,000 - £5,270) × 20% = £2,346
- **Total CGT due: £527 + £2,346 = £2,873**

## Section 104 Pooling Rules

**One of the most complex aspects of UK CGT is the Section 104 pooling rule**, which affects how you calculate gains on shares of the same company bought at different times.

### How Section 104 Works

Instead of first-in-first-out (FIFO), UK tax law pools all shares of the same class in the same company together.

**Pooling Calculation Example:**

**Tom's Share Purchases:**
- January 2023: Bought 1,000 Apple shares at £150 each = £150,000
- June 2023: Bought 500 Apple shares at £180 each = £90,000
- March 2024: Bought 300 Apple shares at £200 each = £60,000

**Pool Summary:**
- Total shares: 1,800
- Total cost: £300,000
- Average cost per share: £300,000 ÷ 1,800 = £166.67

**Sale in September 2024:**
- Sold: 600 shares at £220 each = £132,000
- Cost basis: 600 × £166.67 = £100,002
- **Capital gain: £132,000 - £100,002 = £31,998**

**Remaining Pool:**
- Shares left: 1,200
- Cost basis remaining: £199,998

### Why Section 104 Matters

Without pooling, investors could manipulate which shares they're selling to minimize gains (by selling the highest-cost shares first). Section 104 prevents this by averaging all purchases.

## The 30-Day Rule (Bed and Breakfasting)

**The 30-day rule prevents artificial loss creation** for tax purposes.

### How the Rule Works
If you sell shares at a loss and repurchase identical shares within 30 days, the loss is added to the cost of the new shares instead of being immediately available for tax relief.

### Practical Example

**Lisa's Transaction:**
- Owns 1,000 shares in XYZ Ltd, cost basis £5,000
- Current value: £3,000 (£2,000 loss)
- Sells all shares on March 1st for £3,000
- Repurchases 1,000 shares on March 15th for £3,100

**Tax Treatment:**
- Cannot claim £2,000 loss immediately
- New cost basis: £3,100 + £2,000 = £5,100
- Loss will be realized when finally selling the new shares

### Legal Alternatives to Avoid 30-Day Rule
- **Wait 31 days**: Simple but may miss market movements
- **Spouse transfer**: Sell shares, spouse buys different but similar investment
- **Bed and ISA**: Sell shares, immediately repurchase within ISA wrapper
- **Bed and SIPP**: Sell shares, repurchase within pension

## Record Keeping Requirements

**Accurate record keeping is essential** for CGT compliance and can save thousands in professional fees.

### Essential Records to Maintain

**For Each Transaction:**
- Date of purchase/sale
- Number of shares
- Price per share
- Total consideration (including fees)
- Broker charges and stamp duty
- Currency conversion rates (for foreign shares)

### Professional Record Keeping Example

**David's Apple Share Trading Record:**
| Date | Transaction | Shares | Price | Gross Amount | Fees | Net Amount | Running Total Shares | Running Total Cost |
|------|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 15/01/23 | Buy | 500 | £150 | £75,000 | £12 | £75,012 | 500 | £75,012 |
| 20/03/23 | Buy | 300 | £160 | £48,000 | £8 | £48,008 | 800 | £123,020 |
| 10/07/23 | Sell | -200 | £170 | £34,000 | £10 | £33,990 | 600 | £92,265* |
| 15/09/23 | Buy | 400 | £155 | £62,000 | £10 | £62,010 | 1,000 | £154,275 |

*Cost basis calculation for sale: (£123,020 ÷ 800) × 200 = £30,755

**Capital Gain on July Sale:**
- Sale proceeds: £33,990
- Cost basis: £30,755
- **Gain: £3,235**

### Digital Record Keeping Tools
- **Spreadsheet templates**: Custom Excel/Google Sheets tracking
- **Portfolio apps**: Sharesight, Portfolio Performance, etc.
- **Broker reports**: Most UK brokers provide CGT summaries
- **HMRC online tools**: Basic calculation assistance

## Annual CGT Reporting Requirements

### When You Must Report CGT

**You must complete a Self Assessment tax return if:**
- Total disposals exceed £49,200 (2024-25) - even if no tax is due
- Net gains exceed the £3,000 annual allowance
- You want to claim allowable losses

### CGT Sections in Self Assessment

**Key sections to complete:**
- **Capital gains summary**: Overview of all disposals
- **Listed shares and securities**: Detailed share transactions
- **Unlisted shares and securities**: Private company shares
- **Other gains**: Property, other assets

### Deadlines and Penalties

**Important dates:**
- **January 31st**: Final deadline for online Self Assessment
- **October 5th**: Register for Self Assessment (if new to system)
- **October 31st**: Paper return deadline (if applicable)

**Penalties for late filing:**
- Immediate: £100 penalty
- After 3 months: Additional £10 per day (max £900)
- After 6 months: Additional £300 or 5% of tax due
- After 12 months: Additional £300 or 5% of tax due

## Advanced CGT Planning Strategies

### 1. Annual Allowance Harvesting

**Systematic use of the £3,000 allowance** can save significant tax over time.

**Strategy Example:**
Portfolio worth £100,000 with £50,000 in unrealized gains.

**Without harvesting (selling all in year 10):**
- Gains: £50,000
- CGT allowance: £3,000
- Taxable gains: £47,000
- CGT at 20%: £9,400

**With annual harvesting:**
- Year 1-10: Realize £3,000 gains annually
- Total gains realized: £30,000
- CGT paid: £0 (all within allowances)
- Remaining gains: £20,000
- Future CGT liability: Reduced by £5,400

### 2. Spouse Transfers

**Married couples can double their CGT efficiency** through careful planning.

**Transfer Strategy:**
- Each spouse has £3,000 annual allowance = £6,000 combined
- Transfers between spouses are CGT-free
- Can transfer assets before sale to utilize both allowances

**Example Calculation:**
- Asset with £15,000 gain
- Transfer half to spouse before sale
- Each realizes £7,500 gain
- Less allowances: £7,500 - £3,000 = £4,500 each
- Combined taxable gains: £9,000 vs £12,000 single
- **Tax saved: (£12,000 - £9,000) × 20% = £600**

### 3. Timing of Disposals

**Strategic timing can optimize tax efficiency** across multiple years.

**Cross-Year Strategy:**
Large position to sell worth £20,000 gains:
- December sale: £3,000 (use current year allowance)
- April sale: £17,000 (use next year allowance for £3,000)
- **Result**: £14,000 taxable vs £17,000 = £600 tax saved

## International Considerations

### Foreign Shares and Currency

**UK residents pay CGT on worldwide gains**, with specific rules for foreign assets.

**Currency Conversion Rules:**
- Purchase price: Convert at historic exchange rate
- Sale price: Convert at exchange rate on disposal date
- Currency movements can create additional gains/losses

**Example - US Stock Investment:**
- Bought Apple: $10,000 when £1 = $1.25 (£8,000 cost)
- Sold Apple: $12,000 when £1 = $1.20 (£10,000 proceeds)
- **Sterling gain: £10,000 - £8,000 = £2,000**
- **US$ gain would be: $2,000, but CGT calculated in sterling**

### Double Taxation Relief

**Avoid paying tax twice on the same gains** through Double Taxation Agreements.

**Common scenarios:**
- US withholding tax on US stock sales
- Can often claim credit against UK CGT liability
- May need to file returns in both countries

## Common CGT Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Ignoring Small Gains
**Mistake**: Thinking small transactions don't matter
**Reality**: All gains aggregate towards the £49,200 reporting threshold

### 2. Poor Record Keeping
**Mistake**: Relying only on broker statements
**Reality**: You need detailed records for Section 104 pooling calculations

### 3. Misunderstanding the 30-Day Rule
**Mistake**: Trying to create artificial losses
**Reality**: Same-day and 30-day repurchases have special rules

### 4. Forgetting About Bed and ISA
**Mistake**: Paying CGT unnecessarily
**Reality**: Can sell and repurchase within ISA immediately

### 5. Not Using Spouse Allowances
**Mistake**: One spouse bearing all CGT liability
**Reality**: Free transfers between spouses can double allowances
