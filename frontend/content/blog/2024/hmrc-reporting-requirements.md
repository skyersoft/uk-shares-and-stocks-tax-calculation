# HMRC Reporting Requirements for Stock Transactions

Understanding HMRC's reporting requirements for stock and share transactions is crucial for UK investors. Failure to comply can result in significant penalties, interest charges, and potential investigations. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about when, what, and how to report your investment activities to HMRC.

Whether you're a casual investor with a few share transactions or an active trader with complex portfolios, understanding these requirements will help you stay compliant and avoid costly mistakes.

## Overview of HMRC Reporting Obligations

### Who Must Report to HMRC?

**You must submit a Self Assessment tax return if:**
- Your total proceeds from selling shares exceed £49,200 in a tax year (2024-25)
- Your net capital gains exceed £3,000 (the annual exempt amount)
- You have foreign income/gains requiring reporting
- You want to claim capital losses to carry forward
- HMRC has sent you a tax return to complete

**Important**: Even if you owe no tax, you may still need to report if your total sales exceed the £49,200 threshold.

### Tax Year Basics

**UK Tax Year**: April 6th to April 5th
- **2024-25 tax year**: April 6, 2024, to April 5, 2025
- **Reporting deadline**: January 31, 2026 (online) / October 31, 2025 (paper)
- **Payment deadline**: January 31, 2026

## Capital Gains Tax Reporting Requirements

### When You Must Report CGT

**Mandatory reporting scenarios:**

**1. Gross Proceeds Threshold**
- Total sale proceeds: £49,200+ (2024-25)
- Applies even if no net gain
- Includes all asset sales, not just shares

**2. Net Gains Above Allowance**
- Net capital gains: £3,000+ (2024-25)
- After deducting allowable costs and losses
- Triggers tax liability and reporting duty

**3. Loss Claims**
- Want to carry forward losses to future years
- Must report in year loss occurred or within 4 years
- No minimum threshold for loss reporting

### CGT Reporting Examples

**Example 1: High Turnover, No Net Gain**

Sarah's 2024-25 activity:
- Total sales: £75,000 (exceeds £49,200 threshold)
- Total costs: £72,000
- Net gain: £3,000 (exactly equal to allowance)
- **Result**: Must report, but no tax due

**Example 2: Modest Turnover, Significant Gain**

John's 2024-25 activity:
- Total sales: £25,000 (below £49,200 threshold)
- Total costs: £15,000
- Net gain: £10,000 (exceeds £3,000 allowance)
- **Result**: Must report and pay CGT on £7,000

**Example 3: Loss Claiming**

Emma's 2024-25 activity:
- Total sales: £30,000
- Total costs: £45,000
- Net loss: £15,000
- **Result**: Should report to carry forward loss for future use

## Self Assessment Form Completion

### Capital Gains Tax Pages

**SA108 - Capital Gains Summary**
Key sections to complete:

**1. Summary Page**
- Total proceeds from all disposals
- Total allowable costs
- Any losses brought forward
- Net gains/losses for the year

**2. Listed Shares and Securities**
- Details of each disposal of listed shares
- Number of shares sold
- Date of disposal
- Proceeds after costs
- Allowable costs (including fees)

**3. Unlisted Shares and Securities**
- Private company shares
- Employee share schemes
- Venture Capital Trust disposals

### Detailed Reporting Example

**Michael's Apple Share Disposal (Self Assessment Entry):**

**Transaction Details:**
- Company: Apple Inc.
- Date acquired: March 15, 2020
- Number acquired: 200 shares @ $75 = $15,000
- Date sold: July 10, 2024
- Number sold: 200 shares @ $190 = $38,000
- Sale commission: $15
- Purchase commission: $10

**Currency Conversion:**
- Purchase rate (15/03/2020): GBP/USD = 1.25
- Sale rate (10/07/2024): GBP/USD = 1.20
- Sterling purchase cost: $15,010 ÷ 1.25 = £12,008
- Sterling sale proceeds: $37,985 ÷ 1.20 = £31,654

**SA108 Entry:**
- Description: "Apple Inc. shares"
- Date of disposal: 10/07/2024
- Proceeds: £31,654
- Allowable costs: £12,008
- **Gain**: £19,646

### Section 104 Pooling Reporting

**Complex pooling calculations must be reported accurately:**

**Multi-Purchase Example:**

David's Microsoft holding:
- Purchase 1: 100 shares @ £200 = £20,000 (Jan 2022)
- Purchase 2: 150 shares @ £250 = £37,500 (Jun 2023)
- Purchase 3: 50 shares @ £300 = £15,000 (Dec 2023)
- **Pool**: 300 shares @ £72,500 total cost = £241.67 average

**Sale**: 80 shares @ £350 = £28,000 (Mar 2024)
- **Cost basis**: 80 × £241.67 = £19,333
- **Gain**: £28,000 - £19,333 = £8,667

**SA108 Reporting:**
- Must show pooled cost basis calculation
- Cannot use FIFO or specific identification
- Supporting calculations may be required

## Dividend Income Reporting

### Dividend Tax Reporting Requirements

**When to report dividend income:**
- Total dividend income exceeds £1,000 (2024-25 allowance)
- Higher-rate taxpayers with any dividend income
- Want to claim foreign tax credits

### Dividend Reporting Examples

**Example 1: UK Dividends Above Allowance**

Lisa's 2024-25 dividend income:
- BP plc: £800
- Shell plc: £600
- Vodafone: £300
- **Total**: £1,700

**Tax calculation:**
- Gross dividends: £1,700
- Dividend allowance: £1,000
- Taxable dividends: £700
- Tax due (higher-rate): £700 × 33.75% = £236

**SA106 Entry:**
- UK company dividends: £1,700
- Dividend allowance claimed: £1,000
- Tax due: £236

**Example 2: Foreign Dividends with Withholding**

Mark's US dividend from Apple:
- Gross dividend: $1,000
- US withholding (15%): $150
- Net received: $850
- Sterling value: £708 (at 1.20 rate)

**SA106 Entry:**
- Foreign dividends: £833 (gross sterling equivalent)
- Foreign tax suffered: £125
- UK tax due: £833 × 33.75% = £281
- **Net UK tax**: £281 - £125 = £156
