Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is a tax on the profit when you sell (or 'dispose of') something (an 'asset') that's increased in value. In the UK, this applies to stocks and shares when you sell them for more than you paid.

### Key Points
- CGT only applies when you make a profit on the sale
- You have an annual CGT allowance (£6,000 for 2023-24)
- Different rates apply depending on your income level
- Record keeping is essential for accurate calculations

Using a tax calculator can help you understand your potential liability and plan your investment strategy accordingly.
